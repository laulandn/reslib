Classes for handling classic Macintosh "Resource Forks"
===============

Work in progress...

Does not use GNU autotools for configure, instead goofy shell script...sorry!

Standalone, does not require any libraries other than standard C++

Includes "generic" style resources and some work for Palm equivalent.

reslib_test.cpp is trivial tester.
